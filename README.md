# SimWork - The Future of Skills Assessment & Training

## 🚀 Vision Statement

SimWork revolutionizes how companies hire and train talent by creating the world's first immersive, AI-powered "future of work" simulation platform. We transform traditional, broken hiring processes into engaging, game-like experiences that accurately predict job performance while providing candidates with valuable skill development opportunities.

## 🎯 Mission

To eliminate mis-hires and accelerate workforce readiness through immersive, real-world task simulations that benefit both employers and job seekers.

## 💡 The Problem We Solve

### For Employers
- **Wrong Hires Cost Millions**: Average cost per hire is $4,700 with 23% turnover in first year
